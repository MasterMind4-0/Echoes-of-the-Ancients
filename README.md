Yellow!

This project has been running for a while as of now, but I would like to mention that this project can be discoutinued at ANY time. With, or without a disclaimer. As this is just something that I do just as a side project. There is no real motivator makign me do this besides the satisfaction of being able to say "I made a game" and "I own a game."

With all of that out of the way... You likely need help downloading this right?

To download the code, simply download game.py.

Yay! Your done!
